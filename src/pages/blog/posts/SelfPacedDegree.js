          "I wanted to share a bit about my journey into the tech world, which has been quite an adventure. It all started when I landed a job as a QA Analyst. Honestly, I had no idea then that this was going to be the start of something big for me in tech.<br />So, as a QA Analyst, I was pretty much the gatekeeper of quality, making sure everything worked just right before it got into the users' hands. But as I spent more time around codes and developers, I found myself getting more and more hooked on the idea of building stuff, not just testing it. That's when I started dabbling in web development during my off hours. It was like opening a door to a whole new world – exciting, challenging, and super rewarding.<br />The more I learned, the more I wanted to do this full time. But there was a bit of a hiccup. My company, which I really liked being a part of, had a rule: you need a Computer Science degree to move into development. And that's where things got interesting for me.<br />I started looking around for options. Traditional degrees felt like a no-go; they were too rigid and time-consuming, especially while holding down a full-time job. That's when I stumbled upon this self-paced Computer Science degree from Western Governors University (WGU). It sounded almost too good to be true – learn at your own pace, from home, and still get a legit degree? Sign me up!<br />Embarking on this self-paced journey has been quite the ride. The coolest part is how it fits into my life. I can work through the course material after work, on weekends, or even during a lunch break. It's like my education is tailored around my life, not the other way around.<br />The balance isn't always easy, though. There are days when it feels like a juggling act between work, study, and, well, just life. But the trade-off is totally worth it. I'm not just learning theories; I'm getting hands-on with stuff that directly translates to the kind of work I want to do.<br />Looking back, I never thought I'd go back to school, especially online and at my own pace. But here I am, making it happen. It’s pretty wild to think about where a job in QA has taken me. It’s not just about the degree; it's about pushing my limits and stepping closer to where I want to be in the tech world."
