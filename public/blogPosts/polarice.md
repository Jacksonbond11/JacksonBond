## Long-Lasting Flavor, No Cap

One of the best things about Extra Polar Ice? The flavor **lasts**. Unlike other gums that fade into rubbery sadness after five minutes, Extra keeps its cool. It holds on through awkward silences, long drives, and even those “I should’ve brushed” moments. It's the low-effort hack for keeping your mouth in check all day.

## Perfect Pocket Companion

Let’s be honest — we’ve all got that drawer, backpack pocket, or cup holder with a half-open pack of Extra Polar Ice. And that’s exactly where it belongs. It’s the kind of gum you reach for without thinking because you know it’ll deliver. Fresh breath on demand? Yes, please.

## The Everyday Refresh Button

Extra Polar Ice is simple, dependable, and undeniably cool. It’s not trying to be flashy — just icy, minty, and solid every time. If you haven’t kept a pack on you lately, consider this your sign. Go ahead. Pop one in. You deserve to feel like you just stepped out of a snowstorm with perfect breath.
